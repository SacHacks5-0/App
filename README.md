# FinGuard

## Inspiration
In today's fast-paced world, recent college graduates often find themselves stepping into a new phase of life with high aspirations but limited knowledge about managing their finances. The transition from student life to the working world comes with a host of financial challenges, from paying off student loans to budgeting for everyday expenses and setting long-term financial goals. This inspired us to create FinGuard, an interactive platform that empowers young adults with the knowledge and tools they need to make informed financial decisions and pave their path to a secure and prosperous future.


## What it does
FinGuard is a comprehensive platform tailored to guide recent college graduates and young professionals on their financial journey. Upon entering the platform, users can easily create an account, granting them access to our powerful financial tools. The centerpiece of FinGuard is our Loan Eligibility Predictor, which empowers users to gauge their eligibility for loans by inputting various factors like income, marital status, education, and loan terms. The tool provides an interactive graph displaying loan eligibility, ensuring that users can make informed decisions about their financial future. With FinGuard, we're on a mission to enhance financial awareness among recent graduates, promote smart financial choices, and open the door to financial success.
